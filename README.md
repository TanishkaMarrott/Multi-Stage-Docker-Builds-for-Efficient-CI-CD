# Multi-Stage Docker Builds for Efficient CI/CD

This repository showcases examples of multi-stage Docker builds, aimed at optimizing CI/CD pipelines across various programming languages. By using multi-stage builds, you can significantly reduce Docker image sizes, speed up build times, and streamline your deployment process.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **`NodeJS/`**: Contains a multi-stage Docker build example for a Node.js application.
- **`Python/`**: Contains a multi-stage Docker build example for a Python application.
- **`Java/`**: Contains a multi-stage Docker build example for a Java application.

Each directory includes:
- A `Dockerfile` showcasing the multi-stage build process.
- A `.dockerignore` file to optimize the build context.
- A `README.md` file explaining the specific optimizations applied in that example.

## Why Multi-Stage Docker Builds?

Multi-stage builds allow you to create lean and efficient Docker images by separating the build environment from the runtime environment. This approach helps:
- **Reduce Image Size**: Only the necessary files are included in the final image.
- **Improve Security**: Exclude build tools and unnecessary dependencies from production images.
- **Optimize Build Times**: By reusing build stages and caching intermediate layers, build times are significantly reduced.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Multi-Stage-Docker-Builds-for-Efficient-CI-CD.git
   cd Multi-Stage-Docker-Builds-for-Efficient-CI-CD

2. **Navigate to a Specific Language Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd NodeJS

3. **Build the Docker Image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t your-image-name .

4. **Run the Docker Container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 your-image-name
